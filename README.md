# ReactNativeTicTacToe
A simple TicTacToe Game made with React Native to understand React Native better and challenge myself into making a game without looking at any tutorial 
relying completely on documentation.

Further improvements, perhaps?
<br>
<ol>Would like to implement an AI, check FilipH video on the AI.</ol>
<ol>Would like to discover more about game logic, try the Flutter Puzzle Game and make it in Flutter or React Native. </ol>
